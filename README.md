# 🏙️ Chicago Crime Chronicles

A data engineering and analytics project exploring the **Chicago Crime dataset** using **PySpark, Pandas, and Matplotlib**.  
This project demonstrates how to ingest, clean, transform, and analyze real-world crime data to uncover meaningful insights and trends.

---

## 📊 Features
- Data ingestion and preprocessing with **PySpark**
- Schema definition and transformation of structured/unstructured data
- Time-based analysis (crime trends by date, day of week, etc.)
- Exploratory analysis and visualization with **Matplotlib**
- Handling large-scale data efficiently with distributed processing

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Google Colab** / Jupyter Notebook  
- **PySpark** (ETL, transformations, schema handling)  
- **Pandas** (data manipulation)  
- **Matplotlib** (visualizations)
