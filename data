## ðŸ“‚ Data
The project uses the **Chicago Crime dataset**, which includes historical reports of crimes in Chicago.  
ðŸ”¹ Download the dataset from [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2).  

- Place the dataset inside the `/data/` folder before running the notebook.  
- If you donâ€™t have the full dataset, you can use a smaller sample file for testing.  
- For very large files, you may use Google Drive integration in Colab instead.
